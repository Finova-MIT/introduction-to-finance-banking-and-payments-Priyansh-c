This week, I found the concept of the time value of money (TVM) particularly interesting. 
TVM teaches us that a rupee today is worth more than a rupee in the future because it has the potential to grow when invested.
This principle serves as the foundation for investing, interest rates, and financial decision-making. 
It made me realize why wealthy individuals and corporations prioritize capital allocation and why simply saving money isn't enough to build wealth.

I also gained valuable insights into how interest and debt function. 
The Khan Academy videos clearly explained the effects of simple and compound interest on savings and loans. 
I now understand the importance of managing debt wisely—bad debt can lead to financial struggles, while good debt, 
such as strategic business loans, can accelerate wealth creation.

Looking ahead to 2025, this knowledge is highly relevant to my life.
As someone aiming to build wealth and achieve financial independence, I recognize the necessity of starting to invest early, even in small amounts.
My systematic investment plans (SIPs) in Nifty 50 and Tata Power align with the TVM concept, as they will compound over time. 
Additionally, learning about the evolution of money—from barter to fiat to digital currencies—has made me more aware of financial trends, 
including cryptocurrencies and fintech innovations, which may provide business and investment opportunities.

Overall, this learning experience has reinforced the significance of financial literacy;
it is a skill as valuable as technical knowledge. Mastering finance is essential for making informed decisions, avoiding financial pitfalls, 
and ultimately achieving my goals of wealth and success.
